#
# This is a CloneSquad managed alarm definition tracking the 'CPU Utilization' of EC2 instances managed by CloneSquad. 
#   All these arguments are passed to CloudWatch.PutMetricAlarm API (See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html)
#
#   Before to be sent to this API, CloneSquad performs some variable substitutions (InstanceId, *_SNSTopicArn, GroupName).
#
#   A reference to this file must be set in the CloneSquad configuration (See docs/CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md#cloudwatchalarm00configuration_url)
