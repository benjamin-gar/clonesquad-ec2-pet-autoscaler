v0.2.4:
- (Improvment/Minor) BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY BREAK: Renamed 'ConfigurationURL' template parameter to 'ConfigConfigurationURLs'.
- (Bug/Major) Fixed regression introduced in v0.2.3 about burstable instance management.
- (Bug/Minor) Fixed discovery API enumeration random and rare exception.

v0.2.3:
- - (Improvment/Minor) Makes the  'CPU Crediting mode' more intuitive. If ec2.schedule.max_cpu_crediting_instances is set to 0%, CloneSquad will no more wait for CloudWatch CPU credit balance metric and so enable quick shutdown of t3/t4 instances. Also, t2 instances are not more subject to ‘CPU Crediting mode’ as they can’t preserve CPU Credit over restart.

v0.2.2:
- (Bug/Major) Removed memory caching of http(s):// and s3:// located configuration files.

v0.2.1:
- (Improvment/Minor) Get more details in logs when a config file load fails.
- (Improvment/Major) Added optional 'DynamoDBConfiguration' template.yaml parameter to configure DynamoDB Tables with PROVISIONED capacity instead of default PAY_PER_REQUEST billing model.

v0.2.0:
- (Improvment/Major) Optimized TargetGroup lookup that reduces number of call to "ELBv2" APIs. This reduces execution time of Main Lambda function and make it linear with the number of targetgroups with CloneSquad tags and no more with the number of overall targetgroups into the account.

v0.1.4:
- (Bug/Major) Limit the number of ARNs supplied to elbv2.describe_tags() API call to avoid an exception.

v0.1.3:
- (Bug/Major) Some random rare transient states can lead to a Python exception just after an instance start.

v0.1.2:
- (Bug/major) Fix impact of version name in template.yaml name during extract-version.

v0.1.0:
Note: This a major release with large reworks of the API Gateway code especially.
- (Improvment/Major) Major rework of API Gateway code. Added INTERACTING.md documentation.
- (Improvment/Major) Added new 'Spot recommendation' event support and reworked Spot interruption handling
- (Improvment/Major) Added support for TransferFamily subfleet management. Enable it with 'tranferfamily.enable' set to '1'.
- (Improvment/Minor) Added API GW 'control/reschedulenow' command.
- (Improvment/Minor) Removed some needed less variable output for API Gateway 'discovery'.
- (Improvment/Major) Behavior compatibility break: 'rds.enable' to be set to '1' to activate RDS database support. This change is made to reduce execution duration of the Main Lambda function when RDS database are not the User use-case.
- (Improvment/Major) Behavior compatibility break: Published CloudFormation template filename now contains the CloneSquad version.

v0.0.60:
- (Improvment/Major) Added 'Spot Rebalance recommendation' support and reworked 'Spot interruption handling'.

v0.0.59:
- (Bug/Major) Make sure that we do not send more than 20 metrics per CloudWatch.PutMetricData API call.
- (Improvment/Major) After a set of experiments, it is proven that ensuring the wider scale between AlarmThreshold and 
  AlarmBaselineThreshold induces the best smoothness of the scalein/scaleout algorithm. Prior to this patch, the CPU Baseline 
  Threshold in src/resources/predefined.config.yaml, was set to 20%: Setting it to 0% make the scaleout operation significantly smoother.

v0.0.58:
- (NewFeature/Minor) Added configuration key 'ec2.instance.status.override_url' allowing override of EC2 instance status (for debug and/or external 'unhealthy' status) with an S3/HTTP server located YAML file.
- (Bug/Minor) Fixed buggy set-ec2-alarm.sh scripts. (This script manually triggers a CloneSquad fleet EC2 instance alarm to test autoscaler algorithm reaction.)
- (Improvment/Minor) Add cost estimate for demo-instance-fleet.
- (Bug/Major) Protect public API Gateway with IAM authorizer. Previously API was available without authentication.

v0.0.57:
- (Bug/Major) CloudFormation customization injection was incorrect and complex. Simplified the process with a single CloudFormation parameter 'CustomizationZipParameters'.

v0.0.56:
- (Improvment/Major) Added new setting `ec2.az.evict_instances_when_az_faulty` to force instance eviction from a faulty AZ. Prior to this patch, it was the duty of TargetGroup healthchecks to evict instances. When users use Clonesquad without TargetGroup, users had to scalein/scaleout manually the fleet to evict the instances from the faulty AZ.

v0.0.55:
- (Improvment/Major) Scalin-in algorithm is now smoother as it is taking into account the instance scale ratio relative to 0.0. Prior to this patch, the ScaleIn algorithm was reducing the fleet at full defined scalein rate as soon as it was below the scalein threshold.
- (Improvment/Minor) Added new config flag 'ec2.describe_instance_types.enabled' (disabled by default) to push 4 new CPU and Memory efficiency metrics:
    FleetvCPUCount: Number of CPU serving in the fleet
    FleetvCPUNeed: Number of CPU needed to sustain the load
    FleetMemCount: Amount of Memory serving in the fleet
    FleetMemNeed: Amount of Memory guessed as needed

v0.0.54:
- (Improvment/Minor) Renamed StaticFleet CloudWatch metrics related to EC2 instances to ease dashboard reading
- (Improvment/Minor) Make RDS start/stop better protected against boto3 API exceptions
